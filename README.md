# GameTheory_TIPE
My TIPE (Supervised and Personal Initiative Work) was about the Prisoner's Dilemma. In its iterated form, I did a research of a class of strategies that would be resilient in any kind of strategies environment.

A TIPE is an introduction to scientific research work that I did during my years in CPGE (a two-year intensive program preparing for the national competitive exam for entry to French engineering school)

‘main.py‘ is the final python script of my work. It contains the definition classes of all types of strategies (deterministic strategies, probabilistic strategies and 'player' strategies) and the functions that allow to simulate the Prisoner's Dilemma, the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and the evolution game.

I added in this repo a directory that contains my previous python scripts. They are only subversions of the final script but they display the different steps of the programing of this project.

I also added the slides of my TIPE. They contain explainative images and mathematical formulas needed to understand the project.
